It’s not even time. It’s attention.\" — Naval Ravikant\n\nThe era of GenAI has drastically reduced the marginal cost of producing information, increasing its abundance while making it more challenging to filter for what is truly worth our time. In this new economy, what is scarce and valuable is the attention that information accrues — through clicks, likes, shares, and impressions — representing the flow of value in the trillion-dollar attention economy.\n\nYet, the attention economy today is broken. Creators produce content, users contribute personal data, brands spend huge amounts on advertising — yet the vast majority of the value flows to platforms. \n\nHow do we redefine the relationship among creators, users, brands, and platforms?\n\nHow do we collectively build a fairer and more efficient attention economy, while rewarding all market participants?\n\nAt Kaito, we believe InfoFi is the answer.\n\nNext\nWhy InfoFi\n\nLast updated 7 hours ago\n\n================\nFile: collateral_refunds_buyer_protection_yaptrade_docs.md\n================\n# Collateral, Refunds & Buyer Protection | YapTrade Docs\n\nURL: https://yaptrade.gitbook.io/yaptrade/security-and-escrow/collateral-and-refunds\n\nSECURITY & ESCROW\nCollateral, Refunds & Buyer Protection\n\nTo ensure buyer security, YapTrade implements strict collateral requirements for Kaito airdrop rights sales. If a seller fails to deliver, their collateral is forfeited to the buyer, ensuring that buyers are fully compensated for non-compliance.\n\nIf the agreed amount is not reached, the buyer will receive a full refund solely for the missing votes, including the corresponding fees for those missing votes only.\n\nFor example, if the agreement is for 1 million votes at $20k including fees, but only 900k votes are delivered, the buyer would receive a full refund for solely the 100k missing votes and the fees related to those 100k votes, which would amount to $2k. The rest of the payment, $18k, for the 900k delivered votes, would not be refunded.\n\nPrevious\nHow Escrow Works & Vote Verification\nNext\nFees\n\nLast updated 1 day ago\n\n================\nFile: dao_treasury_flywheel_effect_long_term_vision_yaptrade_docs.md\n================\n# DAO Treasury, Flywheel Effect & Long-Term Vision | YapTrade Docs\n\nURL: https://yaptrade.gitbook.io/yaptrade/fees-and-treasury/long-term-vision\n\nFEES & TREASURY\nDAO Treasury, Flywheel Effect & Long-Term Vision\n\nAll fees go directly to the YapTrade DAO treasury, ensuring that YapTrade has the resources to expand and dominate the influence-based OTC market.

Content other than English has already been earning Yaps and there is no difference in weighting\n\nFurthermore, we are currently looking to deploy regional LLM models to better capture cultural nuances in different regions\n\nDoes my \uD835\uDD4F account need to stay connected to “Kaito AI” to earn points?\n\nNo, Kaito Yaps only relies on initial \uD835\uDD4F authentication (when you first onboard to Yaps) to verify account ownership\n\nOnce initial authentication is done, you can start to accumulate Yap points through your \uD835\uDD4F activities regardless of whether Kaito Yaps stay connected\n\nYou do not need to keep reconnecting every few hours to accumulate Yaps\n\nI'm getting a Captcha verification issue, what can I do? \n\nTry removing ad block if you have it on, it can sometimes cause a Captcha error. \n\nIs there a lag between Tweets and Yaps being awarded?\n\nEach Tweet has a rolling window to earn Yaps \n\nThis is meant to proxy social propagation on CT: tweets typically stay on people's timelines for 24 hours before significantly decaying\n\nHow does Kaito determine whether an \uD835\uDD4F account represents an entity or an individual?\n\nOur AI programmatically analyzes various account attributes - such as the bio, handle, description, profile picture, and tweets - to determine whether an X account represents an entity or an individual. The goal is to approximate how the general audience perceives the account.\n\nDoes Kaito use a spam filter?\n\nYes, Kaito extensively leverages LLM to exclude low-effort content including spams\n\nDo I have to tag Kaito in my tweet for it to qualify?\n\nNo, you do not need to\n\nAre articles being counted in the evaluation system? \n\nYes\n\nWhy do I have 0 yaps?\n\nIf you are not earning Yaps despite your X activity, it could be attributed to one or more of the following reasons:\n\nWe assess a reputation-weighted impact rather than raw impressions or engagements, so if a tweet's cumulative eligible social engagements do not meet a certain threshold, points may not be awarded\n\nYour content may not have been scored as sufficiently insightful or original by our LLM-based evaluation\n\nSimply spamming buzzwords without genuine context or depth won’t register as relevant\n\nI keep getting an authentication error when I try to log in to Kaito Yaps — what should I do?\n\nThis could be due to a lot of ongoing traffic due to X verification rate limit — please try refreshing your page after 15 minutes, testing a different browser or connecting later on\n\nWhy are my Referral points not being reflected?\n\nPeople who joined using your Invite Link needs to start earning Yap points themselves first, before Referral points are credited to you\n\nNote that Referral points are refreshed every hour\n\nWhere can I find my Invite Link & Social Card?\n\nOnce you have signed in, navigate to your profile via https://yaps.kaito.ai/user\n\nOn the top-right, click on “My Social Card”, which will generate a pop-up for you to retrieve your Invite Link, your Social Card, or directly share it to \uD835\uDD4F\n\nInput Wallet on Yaps - how will my wallet address be used and who might this be shared with?\n\nYou have the option to input your wallet address(es) as part of the Yaps platform. Wallet lists may be used by Kaito or shared with other partners (In the form of a list of addresses - anonymized - not including associated X handles) - solely for the purpose of their own reward distribution to these wallet(s).\n\nExamples include:\n\nProject X asks us for a list of wallets for their own (ie Project X) 1000 top Yappers on their Yapper Leaderboard\n\nProject Y asks us for a list of wallets for their own (ie Project Y) voters on the Yapper Launchpad\n\nIf you would no longer like your wallet(s) to be used by Kaito / to be shared with other partners for potential reward distribution, you can remove your wallet(s) at any time. You may also change your inputted wallet(s) at any time.\n\nHow do I input / change / remove my wallet(s) from Yaps?\n\nUtilise the Input / Change Your Wallet button\n\nGlossary\nHow is Total Yaps measured?\n\nTotal Yaps refers to total points you have earned, which is a combined total of Earned Yaps and Referral Yaps\n\nWhat are Smart Followers?\n\nSmart Followers are a set of Crypto Twitter (CT) accounts with the highest inter-following ratios within the CT social graph\n\nThe CT social graph is dynamically and objectively maintained through algorithms\n\nWhat is Mindshare?\n\nMindshare is a metric that quantifies the prominence of a specific project within the overall crypto market\n\nTerms & Conditions for Yaps\n\nYaps is covered under the same Terms & Conditions as Kaito Pro . \n\nLast updated 2 days ago\n\n================\nFile: fees_yaptrade_docs.md\n================\n# Fees | YapTrade Docs\n\nURL: https://yaptrade.gitbook.io/yaptrade/fees-and-treasury/fee-structure\n\nFEES & TREASURY\nFees\n\nYapTrade fees vary depending on the type of transaction:\n\nFor Smart Follower Trades, the buyer pays $15 per SF, with $11 going to the seller and $4 to YapTrade.

This is reflected under 'Current Cap' when you hover over Genesis NFT Holder Votes ratio.\n\nWhere can I see the real-time Holder Votes per Genesis NFT?\n\nRefer to the top banner where you are able to see “1 Genesis NFT ≈ X Holder Votes”.\n\nGenesis NFT Voting\n\nHow do I vote with my Genesis NFTs?\n\nSimply link each wallet holding Genesis NFTs via the ‘Link Wallet’ button at the top banner of Kaito Connect. Once linked, you will be able to vote with Genesis NFTs you own.\n\nI haven’t registered with Kaito Yaps - how can I vote with my Genesis NFT?\n\nCurrently, you will need to register with Kaito Yaps with your \uD835\uDD4F account to vote using your Genesis NFT. In the future, we plan to enable wallet log-in, making the access permissionless.\n\nHow many wallets can I link?\n\nYou can connect multiple wallets holding Genesis NFTs.\n\nWhere can I see how many Genesis NFT votes I have available to vote with?\n\nThe total number of Genesis NFTs shown in 'My Vote' page is the total number of Genesis NFTs across all your linked wallets.\n\nDo I reveal my \uD835\uDD4F account when I vote with Genesis NFT?\n\nNo, only the linked wallet address (holding the Voted Genesis NFT) will be displayed in the 'Vote Details'.\n\nWhat happens to my Genesis NFT votes after submission?\n\nSimilar to Yaps and Smart Follower votes, your Genesis NFT votes are locked for 7 days. During this lock period, you cannot re-vote with that NFT, regardless of ownership changes.\n\nCan I change my linked wallets after I have submitted my votes?\n\nYes. You can add, remove, or switch wallets at any time. If you unlink your wallet, the voting records associated with the wallet will no longer appear (such as under 'Vote Details' or your 'My Votes' page).\n\nWhat’s the difference between the wallet(s) that I’ve input on the site, and these linked wallet(s)?\n\nInput wallet: Wallet address you manually provide through the “Input Wallet” button (next to your name in Yaps). This does not require a wallet signature and is collected solely for reward distribution, either by Kaito or our partner projects. You may remove or update your address at any time if you choose not to participate.\n\nLinked wallet(s): Used to verify ownership of Genesis NFT(s) and other future onchain representations for voting.\n\nPlease note that these wallets are separate, so you'll need to input or link in each place respectively for each use case.\n\nWhat happens if I sell or transfer my NFT after voting for a project?\n\nIf you sell or transfer a Genesis NFT that was used to vote, your vote for the project will still count for 7 days. After 7 days, if you have not bought it back or transferred it back, your vote will expire, and voting rights will be transferred to the new owner.\n\nNote that if you sell your Genesis NFT or transfer it to a wallet that is not linked to Kaito Connect, you will no longer see the voting record under ‘My Votes,’ which always reflects the voting record under your \uD835\uDD4F account and linked wallets. However, as stated above, your vote will still be counted for the project you originally voted for, and you can view it under the ‘Vote Details’ section of that project.\n\nWhat if I buy a Genesis NFT that was used to vote by the previous owner?\n\nYou must wait for its 7-day lock to finish before you can vote with the Genesis NFT.\n\nOnce the lock expires, the vote is automatically redeemed to your wallet.\n\nHow do I check whether a Genesis NFT is available for voting?\n\nTo check whether a Genesis NFT is available for voting, please refer to the 'List of Vote-Locked Genesis NFTs on the Market' under 'My Vote' page.\n\nPrevious\nYapper Votes\n\nLast updated 4 days ago\n\n================\nFile: how_escrow_works_vote_verification_yaptrade_docs.md\n================\n# How Escrow Works & Vote Verification | YapTrade Docs\n\nURL: https://yaptrade.gitbook.io/yaptrade/security-and-escrow/escrow-and-verification\n\nSECURITY & ESCROW\nHow Escrow Works & Vote Verification\n\nYapTrade ensures that no funds are released until the trade is 100% verified. This includes full verification of all votes cast before releasing payments and ensuring that all Smart Follower deals remain valid until TGE.

Sellers list their airdrop rights at a price they are willing to sell for, and both parties agree on a collateral amount to guarantee post-TGE delivery.\n\nAfter both the buyer and seller send the agreed upon funds to escrow, the transaction is secured. When TGE occurs, the seller transfers the airdropped tokens to the buyer. YapTrade verifies the transaction, and only then are funds released to the seller and collateral returned. If the seller fails to deliver, the collateral is forfeited to the buyer, ensuring full protection.\n\nPrevious\nKaito Voting Rights\nNext\nSmart Follower Trades\n\nLast updated 7 days ago\n\n================\nFile: kaito_connect_infofi_network_kaito_ai.md\n================\n# Kaito Connect — InfoFi Network | Kaito AI\n\nURL: https://docs.kaito.ai/kaito-connect-infofi-network\n\nKaito Connect — InfoFi Network\n\nKaito Connect is our AI-powered InfoFi network that combines AI and market forces to redefine how attention and capital flow. Built on a series of interconnected products and frameworks, it ensures genuine contributions are rewarded and value is placed where it truly belongs, creating a more equitable and efficient system for all participants.\n\nCore Values of Kaito Connect\n\nFairness\n\nDemocratized Access: Levelling the playing field. Participants do not need to be influencers — anyone can participate in the network. \n\nValue Redistribution: Participants directly contribute in the redistribution of attention and thus receive a fairer share of the value through a rebalance of power.  \n\nTransparency \n\nTransparency Between Brands and Creators/Users: Rewards for both creators and users are transparent on-chain.\n\nTransparency Between Creators and Users: Due to the nature of public leaderboards, creators automatically disclose the sponsored nature of any content.\n\nEfficiency \n\nNo Intermediaries: No traditional agencies or any other third parties involved.\n\nMerit- and Performance-based: Content with greater impact receives higher rewards.\n\nCore Pillars of Kaito Connect\n\nYaps as Proof-of-Attention — AI-powered tokenized attention \n\nTraditionally, attention has been measured by surface-level metrics such as clicks, views, and impressions. While easy to track and monitor, these parameters fail to capture the real impact.\n\nThrough the introduction of AI models that extract and interpret richer signals (such as social graphs and semantic understanding), the AI-powered algorithm is able to quantify attention and influence in a much more sophisticated way.\n\nYapper Leaderboards — public dashboard for creator contribution \n\nIn the past, brands engaging creators relied on middlemen recommendations and subjective metrics to gauge the influence of a creator.

By continuously reinvesting profits, YapTrade can exponentially scale its control over influence-based trading.\n\nAt the core of this strategy is the purchase of Kaito NFTs, which increase YapTrade’s voting power on Kaito Connect and allow for more votes to be sold. The process works as follows:\n\nYapTrade buys Kaito NFTs, securing governance power and increasing its voting capacity.\n\nThese votes are sold through YapTrade’s OTC marketplace, generating revenue for the DAO.\n\nProfits from vote sales are reinvested into purchasing more Kaito NFTs, further increasing the voting power YapTrade holds.\n\nAs voting power grows, YapTrade controls a larger share of the market, allowing for even more vote sales and deeper liquidity in the OTC market.\n\nWhen Kaito eventually airdrops its token, YapTrade receives a significant airdrop allocation based on its NFT holdings and Kaito builder involvement.\n\nThis airdrop revenue expands YapTrade beyond Kaito, allowing it to develop into the #1 online OTC market for all influence-based and illiquid assets across multiple ecosystems.\n\nThis compounding effect means that every single transaction on YapTrade strengthens the entire system. Unlike static OTC markets that rely on external demand, YapTrade actively reinvests into its own ecosystem, ensuring long-term sustainability and exponential growth.\n\nPrevious\nWhat is YapTrade?\nNext\nKaito Voting Rights\n\nLast updated 7 days ago\n\n================\nFile: tokenomics_coming_soon_yaptrade_docs.md\n================\n# Tokenomics (Coming Soon) | YapTrade Docs\n\nURL: https://yaptrade.gitbook.io/yaptrade/fundraising-and-token-launch/tokenomics\n\nFUNDRAISING & TOKEN LAUNCH\nTokenomics (Coming Soon)\n\nFull details on token supply, allocations, and governance will be provided soon.\n\nPrevious\nFundraise\nNext\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nLast updated 7 days ago\n\n================\nFile: voting_mechanics_kaito_connect_faq.md\n================\n# Voting Mechanics | Kaito Connect FAQ\n\nURL: https://faq.launchpad.kaito.ai/yapper-launchpad-faqs/voting-mechanics\n\nYAPPER LAUNCHPAD FAQS\nVoting Mechanics\nVoting Mechanics (as of Feb 10, 2025)\n\nHow does the voting process work?\n\nVoting is conducted on the Yaps platform, where users (referred to as \"Yappers\") cast their votes to help projects launch their Yapper Leaderboard. \n\nEach Yapper has two types of votes they can use: Yapper Votes and Holder Votes.\n\nHow many votes does each individual have?\n\nEach Yapper's Total Votes = Total Yapper Votes + Total Holder Votes. \n\n\uD835\uDC47\n\uD835\uDC5C\n\uD835\uDC61\n\uD835\uDC4E\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC49\n\uD835\uDC5C\n\uD835\uDC61\n\uD835\uDC52\n\uD835\uDC60\n=\n\uD835\uDC47\n\uD835\uDC5C\n\uD835\uDC61\n\uD835\uDC4E\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC4C\n\uD835\uDC4E\n\uD835\uDC5D\n\uD835\uDC5D\n\uD835\uDC52\n\uD835\uDC5F\n\uD835\uDC49\n\uD835\uDC5C\n\uD835\uDC61\n\uD835\uDC52\n\uD835\uDC60\n+\n\uD835\uDC47\n\uD835\uDC5C\n\uD835\uDC61\n\uD835\uDC4E\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC3B\n\uD835\uDC5C\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC51\n\uD835\uDC52\n\uD835\uDC5F\n\uD835\uDC49\n\uD835\uDC5C\n\uD835\uDC61\n\uD835\uDC52\n\uD835\uDC60\nTotalVotes=TotalYapperVotes+TotalHolderVotes\n\nAre there any restrictions on who can vote?\n\nCurrently, anyone with Yaps or Smart Followers on the Yaps platform can participate in the voting process.

By introducing market forces, this approach has two major advantages:\n\nEfficiency: Market-based systems have proven to be more effective in bringing the world closer to the source of truth — case in point: Polymarket’s role in 2024 US Election. \n\nDecentralization & Fairness: Since market forces are driven by the collective actions of creators and users, this approach also reduces reliance on platform algorithms and facilitates a fairer, trustless redistribution of value across the entire network.\n\nAI-Powered InfoFi\n\nOne of the struggles InfoFi has historically faced is the long-tail problem. While everyone can have a view on the outcome of the US elections, people find it much more difficult to form opinions on the majority of long-tail topics. For example, is Toyota more popular today than it was three months ago? How has sentiment toward Solana NFTs shifted in the past week?\n\nAI, on the other hand, excels at solving long-tail problems. By tokenizing the hard-to-quantify, it provides valuable reference points that enable the formation of markets.\n\nIn fact, we believe AI-powered InfoFi is the endgame for information efficiency:\n\nStage 1: Disorganized information (the past)\n\nStage 2: AI-powered distribution (where we are today)\n\nStage 3: AI-powered InfoFi / market-driven distribution (where we are headed）\n\nWhat AI-Powered InfoFi Unlocks\n\nAttention as an Asset: Transform attention into a quantifiable and valuable resource that can be priced.\n\nMarket-Driven Distribution: Let markets determine which brands or topics deserve attention.\n\nDemocratized Participation: Empower everyone — creators and users alike — to participate and capture their fair share of value in this inclusive economy.\n\nIn this system, AI leverages algorithms to tokenize the digital economy, while market forces serve as the arbiter of value by drawing on the collective participation of all market players. AI-powered InfoFi establishes a new distribution network that is fairer, more transparent, and more efficient.\n\nThis is the heart of what we are building at Kaito.\n\nPrevious\nAttention Economy\nNext\nWhat is Kaito\n\nLast updated 7 hours ago\n\n================\nFile: yapper_launchpad_faq.md\n================\n# Yapper Launchpad FAQ\n\nURL: https://faq.launchpad.kaito.ai/~gitbook/pdf?page=T5UkF73AUwFkQfV2iyav&only=yes\n\n================\nFile: yapper_launchpad_faqs_kaito_connect_faq.md\n================\n# Yapper Launchpad FAQs | Kaito Connect FAQ\n\nURL: https://faq.launchpad.kaito.ai/\n\nYapper Launchpad FAQs\nIntroducing Yapper Launchpad\n\nKaito is introducing a new Yapper Leaderboard launching mechanism: Yapper Launchpad.\n\nSince the launch of Yaps, we have received overwhelming support from the community, for which we are forever grateful.
